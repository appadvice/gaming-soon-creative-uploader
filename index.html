          <h2><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Welcome to the GamingSoon Creatives Resource.</h2>
          <p>GamingSoon is the ultimate destination to get mobile gamers excited about upcoming games.  This tool will allow game developers to upload assets to be displayed on the GamingSoon website and the GamingSoon app. An Asset Spec is available to download in the right hand panel of this page, which serves as templates for a “One Sheet” and a “Half Sheet” for game posters.  Along with these images, developers should upload high quality game trailers, and a summary document which gives a synopsis of the game, as well as release timeframe and estimated price of the game (date and price ranges are fine). Feel free to upload any other assets that may get gamers excited.  Remember interested gamers get notified when the games they select are released! </p>

          <div class="upload-wrapper">
	            <p>We have provided separate sections for you to upload each asset we need.  You can select that file that corresponds to each asset type, or even drag and drop the file right into the browser in the designated area. </p>

              <h3 class="uploader-label"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Video (highest quality available)</h3>
              <p class="uploader-label">This trailer video will be the primary asset our gamers use to decide if they are interested in being notified when the app is released. This video should generate excitement and interest from the user, and be more than just a gameplay trailer. The best trailers focus on the story and the value proposition to the gamer.</p>
              <p>Reference our <a href="video_spec.html">video encoding spec</a> for more details on our uploaded video expectations.</p>

              <h3 class="uploader-label"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>One Sheet Poster</h3>
              <p class="uploader-label">A ‘1-sheet’ is a full size portrait poster image for your game, reminiscent of traditional "movie posters." It should include the name of your game (usually in a condensed typeface), but the rest of the content is up to you. The goal is to help gamers get excited about your game. Be sure to use the template provided in the 'asset spec' (located above in the right margin of this page). The template is marked with an area that will be cropped off on some devices, so please keep the text and important artwork out of the crop zone.</p>
			        <div class="uploader"></div>
			        
			        <h3 class="uploader-label"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Half Sheet Poster</h3>
			        <p class="uploader-label">The ‘half-sheet’ is a landscape hero image.  This image needs to include the name of the game, as it will represent the game in certain areas with no accompanying text. Please follow the template for the 'half-sheet' in the asset spec. </p>
			        <div class="uploader"></div>
			       
			        <h3 class="uploader-label"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Background Sheet</h3>
			        <p class="uploader-label">The 'Background Sheet' is basically the 'half-sheet' provided above, but without any text on it.  It does NOT need to include the name of the game. We will use this 'Background Sheet' as the leaderboard of your app details page in our app. A separate template is provided for this image in the 'asset spec.'</p>
			        <div class="uploader"></div>
			   
			        <h3 class="uploader-label"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Game Description Document</h3>
			        <p class="uploader-label">The Game Description Document should be a .txt document or a PDF or even a word/pages file that describes the details of your game.  We really want users to truly understand your game and why it's awesome.  We don't want it to sound like generic marketing speak, but honestly, what is your game.  What is awesome about it, who will like it, etc? Also please include target release period as well as price range.  If the exact date and price is not finalized please share general idea (eg.August 2014 and less than $2.99).</p>
			        <div class="uploader"></div>
			
			        <h3 class="uploader-label"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Other Assets or Files</h3>
			        <p class="uploader-label">The assets requested above are what we plan to use to make an awesome experience surrounding your upcoming launch.  If you have other materials that you think our gamers would really like, feel free to send those to us as well.  Again this is totally optional and should only be used if you think it really adds something. (Gameplay video? Teaser trailer? commercial?) </p>
